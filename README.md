# Emotion-Dataset-from-Indonesian-Public-Opinion

## Abstract
Opinion is a type of judgment or a person's point of view about something. Twitter is a popular social media platform that includes a lot of public opinion and
would be a suitable location to mine data in text form. Indonesia, with its vast population and active Twitter user base, has the potential to be a source of
opinion data mining. An opinion may be processed and resulting in the form of a person's emotion response towards something, such as whether they like, hate, love,
or happy about it. Upon that basis, a dataset of Indonesian-language tweets conveying public opinion on a variety of topics was formed. The fact that there are so
few public emotion text datasets in Indonesian language also supports our basis in this research to form our emotion dataset. The gathered data was cleaned and
normalized in the pre-processing stage to the necessary form for study on the task of classifying emotions in Indonesian. The data formed is annotated with six
emotional labels, namely anger, fear, joy, love, sad, and neutral.
